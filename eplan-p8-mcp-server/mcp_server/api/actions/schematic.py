"""
Schematic authoring - create pages, place devices, wire them, read it back.

This is the write side of the live object model. The read-only tools in live.py
can enumerate a project; these can BUILD one, which is what a model needs before
it can draw a schematic rather than describe one.

Six primitives, in the order a caller uses them:

    live_symbol_catalog     what symbols exist, and where their pins are
    live_create_page        a new schematic page
    live_place_symbol       a device on that page at a coordinate
    live_connect_pins       a connection line between two devices' pins
    live_read_page          the canonical page state
    live_remove_placement   undo one placement, or the whole page

DESIGN RULES, each of which exists because its absence produced a real failure
during development:

1. EVERY WRITE RETURNS THE READ-BACK. `page_after` on a write is the SAME
   structure `live_read_page` returns, produced by the same C# serializer, so a
   write and a later verification cannot disagree. EPLAN's auto-connect
   frequently does something other than what was asked; the only way a model
   learns that is by being shown what actually landed.

2. A REFLECTIVE MISS IS FATAL, AND SAYS WHAT THE TYPE DECLARES. During the
   spike, reading `Page.Placements` - a property that does not exist - returned
   null, the code treated null as "no placements", and it reported an empty page
   after successfully creating three objects. A silent miss is exactly how a
   write appears to succeed having done nothing, so the helpers in live.py throw
   with a MemberList instead. The correct accessor is `AllPlacements`.

3. WRITES ARE SCRATCH-GUARDED BY DEFAULT. `allow_real_project=False` is the
   signature default and the guard runs twice: once in Python before the script
   is even built, and again inside the LockingStep against the project EPLAN
   actually has focused - because between those two moments the user could have
   switched projects. Master data on a real workstation resolves to production
   paths; a schematic writer loose in a live project is not an acceptable
   default.

4. NEVER `new PointD(...)`. The point type is always taken from the member the
   point is handed to (`create.GetParameters()[2].ParameterType`), because the
   script engine may compile against a different Eplan.EplApi.Base than the
   loaded object model references, and a typeof()-built signature then silently
   matches nothing.

MEASURED ON EPLAN 2027.0.1 - the call forms below are the ones that actually
work, not the ones the docs suggest:

    Page.Create(Project, DocumentType, PagePropertyList)      (only 3-arg form)
    new SymbolLibrary(Project, name) / new Symbol(lib, name)
    new SymbolVariant(Symbol, int)                            (NOT (int) alone)
    Function.Create(Page, SymbolVariant, PointD, PointD)      INSTANCE method
    DynamicConnectionLine.Create(Page) + SetGraphics(PointD, PointD)
    Page.AllPlacements / Page.Functions                       (NOT .Placements)

Traps that cost real debugging time, all encoded below:

  - PropertyValue has NO public constructor. `Activator.CreateInstance(pvType,
    "P1")` throws MissingMethodException; it is built through its static
    op_Implicit. See live.MakeValue.
  - A SymbolVariant instance CANNOT be reused: the second Create throws
    ObjectAlreadyCreatedException. A fresh SymbolLibrary+Symbol+SymbolVariant is
    built per placement, so a batch loop must NOT hoist them.
  - PointD.ToString() returns the type name, not coordinates. Read X/Y.
  - A placed Function's Name is "+" until a device tag is assigned - placing and
    tagging are separate operations.
  - Page naming follows project structure settings, so the created page's Name
    is READ BACK and reported rather than predicted.
  - Not every symbol name exists in a library, which is why symbol discovery is
    primitive #1 rather than an afterthought.

    Discover the symbols available in the open project, and their pins.

    Start here. A model cannot place a symbol it cannot name, and symbol names
    are not guessable: on the reference installation "SL", "S", "O", "Q1" exist
    in NFPA_symbol_en_US while "K1" and "M1" do not. There is no naming
    convention to fall back on.

    Three depths, selected by which arguments you pass:

        ()                        -> the project's symbol libraries
        (library="NFPA_symbol_en_US")
                                  -> that library's symbols, with pin counts
        (library=..., symbol="SL")
                                  -> that symbol's variants and each variant's
                                     connection points

    Symbols come from the project's OWN libraries, so this reflects what this
    project can actually place - a scratch clone carries project-local copies
    inside its .edb, which is why writing to a clone cannot touch production
    master data.

    Args:
        library: Symbol library name. Omit to list libraries.
        symbol: Symbol name within `library`. Requires `library`.
        contains: Case-insensitive substring filter on symbol names, applied at
            depth 2. A symbol with >= 2 connection points is one you can wire.
        limit: Max entries returned at the chosen depth (default 100).
        timeout_seconds: Walking a large library is slow; default 120s.

    Returns:
        depth 1: {"libraries": [name, ...]}
        depth 2: {"library", "symbols": [{"index", "name", "connectionPoints",
                  "variantCount"}, ...], "matched", "returned", "truncated"}
        depth 3: {"library", "symbol", "variants": [{"variantNr", "pins":
                  [{"index", "designation", "raw"}]}]}

        A symbol's pin geometry is RELATIVE to its insertion point until it is
        placed, so at depth 3 "raw" is exactly that and no absolute coordinate
        is reported.

    Create a schematic page in the open project. WRITES - scratch-only by default.

    The page's final NAME is read back and returned rather than predicted,
    because page naming follows the project's structure settings: on the
    reference installation, setting plant + location + counter produced
    "+SPIKE5/950" - the plant designation did not appear in the name at all. Use
    the returned "page" value for every later call.

    Only name-forming properties can be set at creation time; that is EPLAN's
    own documented restriction on the property list Page.Create accepts.

    There is deliberately NO `description` argument. PagePropertyList has no
    page-description member - checked by reflection on 2027.0.1, which lists
    only DESIGNATION_*_DESCR (descriptions OF a structure identifier) and
    PAGE_CUSTOM_SUPPLEMENTARYFIELD01..100. Setting a description needs the
    generic Property[AnyPropertyId] indexer and a decision about which property
    id a "page description" is, which is a separate change rather than a guess
    made here. Until then, a caller asking for one gets no argument to pass
    rather than an argument that silently does nothing.

    Args:
        plant: Plant designation (the "=" part). Optional.
        location: Location designation (the "+" part). Optional.
        counter: Page counter - the numeric part of the name. Default 1.
        page_type: A DocumentTypeManager.DocumentType name. Default "Circuit",
            which is the ordinary multi-line schematic page. Common values:
            Circuit, CircuitSingleLine, Overview, Graphics, PanelLayout,
            TerminalDiagram, InterconnectDiagram, CableLayout. An unknown value
            is refused with the real enum names.
        allow_real_project: Must be True to write to a project outside the
            scratch root. Default False - see the module docstring.

        (one eighth inch) on the reference installation. Placing off-grid tends

    Place a device (Function) on a page at a coordinate. WRITES - scratch-only by default.

    Uses Function.Create(Page, SymbolVariant, PointD, PointD), which places
    directly at the target coordinate. There is deliberately no create-then-move
    step: a device that exists momentarily at (0,0) can auto-connect to whatever
    is near the origin of a populated page.

    The placed function's NAME will be "+" - a function is unnamed until a device
    tag is assigned, which is a separate operation. That is expected, not a
    failure.

    Args:
        page: Page name, exactly as live_create_page or live_read_page reports it.
        library: Symbol library name (see live_symbol_catalog).
        symbol: Symbol name within that library.
        x, y: Insertion point in page millimetres.
        variant_nr: Symbol variant index, default 0 (variant "A").
        x2, y2: Opposite corner of the function's logical area. Both default to
            the insertion point, giving a degenerate rectangle there. Pass them
            only if a placement needs an explicit extent.
        snap_to_grid: Round coordinates to the page's own GridSize before
            placing (default True). Off-grid devices commonly look correct and
            then refuse to auto-connect.
        allow_real_project: Must be True to write outside the scratch root.
        timeout_seconds: Default 90s.

    Returns:
        {"success", "page", "handle", "placed" (the DumpPlacement record,
         including absolute pin coordinates), "requested"/"snapped" coordinates,
         "undo": {...}, "page_after"}

        "unknown" pin has "point": null and MUST NOT be treated as (0,0) - the

    Draw an EXPLICIT connection line between two pins. WRITES - scratch-only.

    Usually the wrong tool. Two pins that FACE each other on a shared axis are
    already wired: EPLAN draws an autoconnecting line between them and no object
    exists on the page. Measured on a real page - four Functions, zero line
    objects, two wires rendered. Drawing a line over that run adds a redundant
    object on top of a connection EPLAN had already made.

    Reach for this only when autoconnect cannot apply: a run that has to be
    drawn explicitly across a page. For an ordinary turn place a corner
    (`live_place_corner`); for a branch a T-node (`live_place_tnode`); for a
    straight run between facing pins, place the two devices in line and draw
    nothing.

    Addresses the endpoints by HANDLE and PIN INDEX rather than by coordinate,
    so the caller never computes a millimetre: the server resolves each pin's
    absolute position and draws between them.

    Only straight segments. A DynamicConnectionLine's SetGraphics(p1, p2) is one
    segment, so if the two pins share neither X nor Y this refuses rather than
    drawing a diagonal EPLAN will not treat as a wire. Move one device onto the
    other's axis, or place an intermediate device.

    IMPORTANT about what "connected" means here: this draws the graphical
    connection line and reports the resulting page state. Whether EPLAN's
    connection logic has produced a logical Connection object between the two
    functions is a separate question that needs a report generation to settle -
    so the result says "lineDrawn", not "devices are wired".

    Args:
        page: Page name both placements are on.
        from_handle, to_handle: Handles from live_place_symbol or live_read_page.
            Handles are valid only within one EPLAN session.

    Read one page's full state: every placement, its geometry and its pins.

    This is the canonical page reader, and every write above returns exactly
    this structure as "page_after" - produced by the same C# serializer - so a
    write's own report and a later verification cannot disagree.

    It is also the discovery route that matters most in practice: run it against
    a page a human drew and every Function answers with its
    symbol{library, name, variantNr} triple, which tells you which symbols this
    company actually uses rather than what master data merely contains.

    Args:
        page: Page name, exactly as reported elsewhere.
        include_pins: Include each placement's connection points (default True).
        limit: Max placements returned; the true count is always reported so a
            truncated read is never mistaken for a complete one.
        types: Only return placements of these CLR types, e.g. ["Function"] for
            devices or ["DynamicConnectionLine"] for wires. Omit for everything.

            USE THIS when you are looking for devices. A real schematic page is
            mostly graphics: measured on a production go-by, one Circuit page
            held 1887 placements whose first 40 were all PolyLine. Unfiltered,
            `limit` is exhausted on graphics before a single device is reached,
            and the page looks empty.
        timeout_seconds: Default 90s.

    Returns:
        {"success", "page", "pageType", "gridSize", "size", "placementCount",
         "returned", "truncated", "placements": [...]}

        Each placement: {"clrType", "handle", "name", "location",
        "boundingBox", "symbol", "pins", "absentMembers"}.

        "absentMembers" lists members this placement TYPE does not have (a
        connection line has no SymbolVariant, for instance). It is reported
        rather than silently omitted, because a silently missing field is
        indistinguishable from a write that did nothing.

        Every pin carries "frame" ("absolute"/"relative"/"unknown") and a
        "point" that is null when the frame is unknown. Never read a null point
        as (0,0).

    """
    Check a page against a description of what it SHOULD contain.

    This is what turns the primitives from append-only into something that can
    CONVERGE. Without it a caller can add to a page but has no way to state a
    target and be told exactly what does not match, so "did what I intended
    land?" stays an eyeball job over a large JSON dump.

    `expected` is written in live_read_page's OWN schema, as a SUBSET. That is
    the point: the read format doubles as the specification format, so there is
    no second vocabulary to learn and a verification is just "re-read, then
    compare". Copy a read result, cut it down to what you care about, and it is
    a valid expectation.

    Only keys present in `expected` are compared. Everything else is ignored, so
    you can assert on one device's position without describing the whole page.

    Reads only - nothing is modified.

    Args:
        page: Page name.
        expected: A subset of a live_read_page result. Recognised keys:
            "placementCount" - exact number of placements on the page.
            "placements"     - a list of partial placement records, each matched
                               by "handle" if given, otherwise by "clrType" +
                               "location" + "name", whichever are present.
            A placement record may carry "clrType", "name", "handle" and
            "location" ({"x", "y"}).
        tolerance: Millimetres within which two coordinates count as equal
            (default 0.05 - deliberately under half a grid step, so devices on
            ADJACENT grid points are never treated as the same place).
        timeout_seconds: Default 90s.

    Returns:
        {"success", "match": bool, "differences": [str, ...], "page_state"}

        "differences" names each mismatch in the caller's own terms - what was
        expected and what was found - so a failed verification says what to fix
        rather than only that something is wrong. "page_state" is the full read
        the comparison ran against, so no second call is needed for context.

    Example:
        live_verify_page("+MCP/1", {
            "placementCount": 3,
            "placements": [{"clrType": "Function",

    Give a placed function its device tag. WRITES - scratch-only by default.

    A function placed by live_place_symbol is ANONYMOUS: its name is "+" until a
    tag is assigned (measured on 2027). An anonymous device looks placed in the
    GED but is invisible to every name-addressed tool - live_query_functions,
    live_set_function_text, search_devices - so placing and tagging are two
    steps, and only the first existed before this.

    DUPLICATE TAGS ARE REFUSED BY DEFAULT, and that default is the point.
    Assigning a tag that already exists does not error in EPLAN: it MERGES this
    function into that device as a further sub-function. For a contactor's coil
    and its contacts that is exactly right; for a model reusing a tag by
    accident it silently rewires the schematic. So the safe reading is the
    default and the useful one is opt-in.

    Args:
        page: Page the function is on.
        handle: Handle from live_place_symbol or live_read_page. Session-scoped.
        tag: The device tag, e.g. "-K1", "+1162-MA1", "=AP+ST1-Q2". Written to
            Function.Name, which reflection on 2027 reports as directly
            writable. The result reports the name EPLAN actually stored, since
            project structure settings can reformat it.

    Read the project's LOGICAL connections - what is actually wired to what.

    This is the difference between "a line was drawn" and "these two devices are
    connected". live_connect_pins proves GRAPHICAL adjacency: a line touches two
    pins. The logical `Connection` objects are what carry connection
    designations, wire numbers, cable assignment and every report - and they do
    not exist until EPLAN generates them.

    Without this, a caller told "connected: true" could reasonably conclude the
    schematic is electrically correct when it is not. That is a source of false
    confidence in the one layer built to prevent it.

    READ-ONLY. This deliberately does NOT run eplan_generate_connections for
    you: generating connections MUTATES the project, and a tool named "read"
    that quietly writes is exactly the kind of surprise this layer exists to
    avoid. If nothing comes back, the result says so and names the tool to run.

    Args:
        page: Only connections on this page. Omit for the whole project.
        device: Only connections with at least one end on a device whose tag
            CONTAINS this text (case-insensitive). Use it to scope to one
            terminal strip - "+P01-XT" matches every terminal of that strip.
            A real project has thousands of connections, so an unscoped read is
            almost always truncated.
        limit: Max connections returned (default 200). The true total is always
            reported, so a truncated read is never mistaken for the whole set.
        timeout_seconds: Default 120s - a project-wide walk is not fast.

    Returns:
        {"success", "connections": [...], "total", "matched", "returned",
         "truncated", "page", "device"}

        Each connection: {"handle", "page", "kindOfWire", "isPlaced",
        "from": {...}, "to": {...}} where each end carries "device" (the device
        tag), "clrType" ("Terminal" vs "Function", so a terminal end is
        identifiable without reading a property), "designation" (the connection
        point), "pinIndex" and "location" (page-space).

        Jumper-relevant fields, when the connection carries them:

          connectionType / connectionTypeName
              CONNECTION_TYPE #31075. 5 = "Jumper (automatic)" is how EPLAN
              marks a jumper, and it is what the terminal strip editor renders.
              NOTE kindOfWire cannot answer this: its members are
              IndividualConnection/Cable/Conduit/PhaseBusbar/Line, with no
              jumper among them - it is the cable axis, not this one.
          saddleJumperSlot
              CONNECTION_SADDLEJUMPER_SLOT #31163, 1..5.

        A property that is absent, or that threw on read, is listed in
        "absentMembers" rather than quietly omitted - so "no jumper properties
        here" stays distinguishable from "this build cannot read them".

        When the project has NO connections at all, "stale" is true and
        "nextStep" names eplan_generate_connections - because zero connections
        almost always means they have not been generated yet, not that nothing
        is wired.

    Read a terminal strip's terminals and every jumper-bearing property on them.

    This exists because the jumpers you can SEE in EPLAN's terminal strip editor
    are not reachable any other way through this server. The editor is not a
    separate data source - it renders connections plus these terminal
    properties - and neither live_read_connections nor a generic function walk
    could reach them:

      - live_read_connections reports kindOfWire, whose five members are
        IndividualConnection/Cable/Conduit/PhaseBusbar/Line. There is no jumper
        among them; it is the cable axis. (It now also reports CONNECTION_TYPE,
        which IS the jumper discriminator - see that tool.)
      - FUNC_TERMINAL_JUMPERBAR and the jumper crests live on the TERMINAL, not
        on the connection, so no amount of connection reading finds them.

    READ-ONLY. Nothing here writes, and it deliberately does not touch the
    jumper properties: writing a crest would flip a strip from Automatic to
    Manual and change how EPLAN's own terminal diagrams render it.

    Args:
        device: Only terminals whose tag CONTAINS this text (case-insensitive).
            "+P01-XT" matches every terminal of that strip. Omit for all
            terminals in the project, which on a real project is a lot.
        page: Only terminals placed on this page. Omit for any page.
        limit: Max terminals returned (default 200). The true total and the
            matched count are always reported.
        timeout_seconds: Default 120s - a project-wide walk is not fast.

    Returns:
        {"success", "terminals": [...], "total", "matched", "returned",
         "truncated", "device", "page"}

        Each terminal carries "handle", "device", "page", "location"
        (page-space insertion point - the anchor a jumper dot is offset from),
        "isMainTerminal", and:

          FUNC_TERMINALSORTCODE, FUNC_TERMINALDEVICEPOSITION, level
              Where the terminal sits in the STRIP. This is what orders a
              jumper chain - not page position. Sort code is a string and may

              Populated only for MANUAL saddle jumpers, so null is the expected

              API reference it CREATES a switching jumper connection to the

    DRAW two segments through an elbow. WRITES - scratch-only.

    Not the normal way to turn a wire. The normal way is to place a corner
    SYMBOL with `live_place_corner` and let EPLAN autoconnect into it - verified
    live, that produces one clean logical connection between the two devices,
    with the corner at neither end. This tool instead draws the line objects
    itself, which leaves geometry on the page that EPLAN did not derive.

    It stays because a drawn elbow is still the answer when no autoconnecting
    path exists - the free-routing case the `DynamicRouting` symbols cover, rare
    in practice: 18 placements out of roughly 5000 on one measured production
    project, all on a single page.

    If both pins can be brought onto a shared axis, or joined by a placed
    corner, prefer that.

    Args:
        page: Page both placements are on.
        from_handle, to_handle: Handles from live_place_symbol or
            live_read_page. Session-scoped.
        from_pin, to_pin: Pin indices, from live_read_page's "pins".
        corner: Which way the elbow turns.
            "x" - leave the FROM pin horizontally, arrive at the TO pin
                  vertically. Corner sits at (to.x, from.y).
            "y" - leave vertically, arrive horizontally. Corner at
                  (from.x, to.y).
            Pick the one whose corner does not land on top of another device;
            the result reports the corner so you can check.
        allow_real_project: Must be True to write outside the scratch root.

        BOTH segment handles come back, so the undo is complete - removing only
        one would leave half a wire behind, which is worse than leaving the whole
        thing.

    Discover the CONNECTION symbols this project can use - corners, T-nodes,
    crosses, interruption points - and which directions each variant faces.

    You need this before placing any of them, and it must be DISCOVERED rather
    than assumed: a project carries several symbols for the same job. Measured
    on one production installation, `SPECIAL_en_US` alone holds 16, including
    TWO different `TNodeUp` symbols (`TLRO` and `TLRO_1`) that differ only in
    pin ORDER, and six interruption-point symbols - some two-pin, some one-pin
    and directional.

    So "the corner symbol" is not a constant. Ask what this project has.

    A connection symbol is identified by `Symbol.Type`, not by its name. The
    types that matter:

        Routing            a corner
        TNodeUp/Down/Left/Right    a branch - a SEPARATE TYPE per direction,
                           not a variant, unlike corners
        RoutingCross       four-way crossing
        RoutingBridge      hop over without connecting
        DynamicRouting     free/diagonal routing
        InterruptionPoint  cross-page jump
        ConnectionDefinition  carries wire number, colour, cross-section
        PotentialDefinition, PotentialTerminal, Shielding,
        CableDefinitionLine, NetDefinition

    Reads only.

    Args:
        symbol_type: Filter to one Symbol.Type, e.g. "Routing" for corners or
            "TNodeUp" for upward branches. Omit for all connection symbols.
        directions: Filter to variants whose pins face exactly this SET of
            directions, e.g. ["Right", "Down"] for a corner turning east and
            south. Order is ignored for matching but REPORTED in the result,
            because two symbols of the same type can differ only in pin order.
        library: Restrict to one symbol library. Omit to search all the
            project's libraries - which is usually right, since on the measured
            installation every routing symbol lived in ONE library and the
            device libraries had none.
        timeout_seconds: Default 180s; this walks every library.

    Returns:
        {"success", "libraries" (all searched), "symbols": [...], "matched",
         "byType"}

        Each symbol: {"library", "symbol", "type", "variants": [{"variantNr",
        "directions": ["Right","Down"]}]}.

        When `directions` is given, each symbol also carries "matchingVariants"
        - the variant numbers whose direction SET matches. If more than one
        symbol matches, they are ALL returned rather than one being chosen:
        which is correct is a house convention, not something this can decide.

    Place a CONNECTION symbol - a corner, T-node, cross, interruption point.
    WRITES - scratch-only by default.

    This is a separate tool from `live_place_symbol` because EPLAN places the
    two through different APIs. A routing symbol is not a `Function`, and
    `Function.Create` refuses one with `S511085Cannot create function`, which
    names no cause. The path that works is `SymbolVariant.Create(Page)`,
    returning a `SymbolReference`. Measured on 2027 with `SPECIAL_en_US/CO`.

    Prefer `live_place_corner` or `live_place_tnode`, which pick the symbol out
    of the project instead of making you name one. Reach for this directly when
    you already know exactly which symbol and variant you want, or for a type
    those two do not cover (`RoutingCross`, `InterruptionPoint`, `Shielding`).

    A caveat you should know about: `SymbolVariant.Create` takes no coordinate.
    The object is born at the page ORIGIN and moved. This script moves it inside
    the same locking step, before anything can observe it there, and connections
    are only ever computed on demand by `generate_connections` - so the transit
    is not visible to EPLAN's connection logic. It is still the reason this tool
    reports `bornAtOrigin: true`: if a page ever does acquire a stray connection
    near (0,0), that is where to look.

    Args:
        page: Page name, exactly as `live_create_page` or `live_read_page` reports it.
        library: Symbol library name (see `live_routing_catalog`).
        symbol: Symbol name within that library.
        x, y: Where the symbol's connection vertex goes, in page millimetres.
            For a corner both pins sit exactly here - a corner's two connection
            points coincide at the turn, which is why one coordinate places it.
        variant_nr: Variant index. For a corner this IS the rotation - measured
            on `CO`: v0 Right+Down, v1 Right+Up, v2 Left+Up, v3 Left+Down.
        snap_to_grid: Round to the page's own GridSize first (default True).
            An off-grid connection symbol looks right and refuses to autoconnect.
        allow_real_project: Must be True to write outside the scratch root.
        timeout_seconds: Default 90s.

    Returns:
        {"success", "page", "handle", "placed", "requested"/"snapped",
         "symbolType", "undo", "page_after"}

    Refuses a device symbol, pointing at `live_place_symbol` - the mirror of the
    check that tool makes.

    Place a T-node where a wire branches three ways. WRITES - scratch-only by
    default.

    Note the asymmetry with corners, which is EPLAN's and not ours: a corner is
    ONE symbol whose four rotations are variants, but a T-node is a separate
    `Symbol.Type` per direction - `TNodeUp` is a different type from
    `TNodeDown`. So a corner is chosen by variant and a T-node by type. That is
    why this takes a single `branch_direction` rather than a direction list.

    Args:
        page: Page name.
        x, y: The junction, in page millimetres.
        branch_direction: Which way the third leg points - "Up", "Down", "Left"
            or "Right". The other two legs run along the perpendicular axis, so
            "Up" means a horizontal run with a branch rising out of it.
        symbol: Name a symbol explicitly. A real project can hold two T-nodes of
            the SAME type differing only in pin order - measured, `TLRO` and
            `TLRO_1` are both `TNodeUp`. When that happens this refuses and
            lists them rather than flipping a coin.
        variant_nr: Force a variant.
        snap_to_grid: Default True.
        allow_real_project: Must be True to write outside the scratch root.

    Place a device already lined up to autoconnect with a pin on the page.
    WRITES - scratch-only by default.

    This is the tool that removes coordinate arithmetic from schematic
    authoring. You say "put a contact 40mm below -K1's pin 2"; it works out
    where the symbol has to sit so its own pin faces that one across a shared
    axis, which is the condition EPLAN needs to draw an autoconnecting line.

    No line is drawn, and none should be. Two facing pins on a shared axis ARE
    the connection - `generate_connections` then materialises a logical
    Connection between them. Verified live: -K1 -> corner -> -K2 laid out this
    way produced one connection, `+-K1[2] -> +-K2[1]`.

    How the new symbol is oriented is NOT decided here. `variant_nr` is the
    rotation - measured on `NFPA_symbol_en_US/SL`, v0 faces Up/Down and v1 faces
    Left/Right - and the variant you pass must actually have a pin facing back
    toward the anchor, or this refuses. Picking a rotation for you would be
    guessing at the drawing's intent.

    Args:
        page: Page the anchor is on. The new symbol goes on the same page.
        to_handle: Handle of the placement to line up with, from
            `live_place_symbol` or `live_read_page`. Session-scoped.
        to_pin: Which of its pins, by index, as `live_read_page` reports them.
            That pin's `direction` sets the axis and which way the run goes.
        library, symbol: The symbol to place.
        distance: Millimetres between the two PINS, measured along the run.
            Must be positive and a whole multiple of the page grid - an
            off-grid pin looks correct and refuses to autoconnect. The
            placement location is derived from this, not passed.
        variant_nr: Rotation of the new symbol, default 0.
        new_pin: Which pin of the new symbol faces the anchor. Needed only when
            the chosen variant has more than one pin facing that way; with
            exactly one, it is inferred.
        allow_real_project: Must be True to write outside the scratch root.
        timeout_seconds: Default 120s - this reads the symbol library first.

    Returns:
        The `live_place_symbol` result, plus "alignment": the anchor pin, the
        new pin, the shared axis, and the location that was solved for.

    Refuses rather than placing something that will not connect: a pin with no
    direction, a variant with no pin facing back, an ambiguous choice of pin, or
    a distance that is not a grid multiple.
