AI-assisted automation for **EPLAN Electric P8** and **EPLAN EEC Pro 2026**, built on the
Model Context Protocol (MCP).

This repository contains the local MCP server that drives a running EPLAN instance.
The three remote documentation RAGs live in the separate
[eplan-cloudflare-rags](https://github.com/covagashi/eplan-cloudflare-rags) repository.

## What is MCP?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open standard that lets AI assistants interact with
external tools and services. Rather than only generating code, Claude can *execute* actions
inside EPLAN in real time and consult the documentation through search.

## Quick start

### Local EPLAN automation (P8)

```bash
python YOURPATH/eplan-p8-mcp-server/install.py   # own .venv + registers "eplan"
claude mcp list   # should list "eplan"
```

Then start EPLAN, open Claude Code, and say `connect to eplan`. The full guide is in
[`eplan-p8-mcp-server/mcp_server/README.md`](eplan-p8-mcp-server/mcp_server/README.md).

#### Prerequisite

Remoting must be enabled in EPLAN before the server can connect: turn on **Allow remote
access via Remote Client** under **File → Settings… → Workstation → Interfaces → Remote
access**.

![Allow remote access via Remote Client](Remoting_Setting_AllowLocalAccess.png)

#### What the server exposes

In its default `full` mode the server publishes **199 tools**:

| Group | Count | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| Connection / utility | 8 | Connect, version selection, status, extension listing |
| Typed EPLAN actions (`eplan_*`) | 183 | One tool per documented or verified action, each executed silently inside a C# script under QuietMode, so no EPLAN dialog can block an unattended run |
| Action catalog (`eplan_action_catalog` / `_describe` / `_run` / `_ribbon_catalog`) | 4 | Reaches a further ~1,050 actions that exist only as GUI buttons, mined from the install's `MFTools.xml` rather than the official docs |
| Asset Administration Shell (`aas_*`) | 4 | AAS/AASX digital-twin export and import |

The ~1,050 catalog actions are deliberately *not* given one wrapper tool each: that would
have tripled the tool count and degraded tool selection for everything else.

Among the 183 typed tools are four live-DataModel tools —
`eplan_live_query_functions`, `eplan_live_query_pages`, `eplan_live_set_function_text`
and `eplan_live_set_connection_designations` — which read and edit the open project's
object model through runtime reflection, working around the script engine's limitation on
static `using` directives.

Beyond individual actions, the toolset covers the building blocks of a fully unattended
develop → deploy → test loop:

- **Application lifecycle** — `eplan_app_launch` / `eplan_app_shutdown` /
  `eplan_app_restart`: exit EPLAN, swap add-in DLLs, relaunch, reconnect, reopen the project.
- **Disposable fixtures** — `eplan_scratch_project_*`: scratch projects cloned from a template.
- **Diagnostics** — `eplan_get_system_messages`: read EPLAN's message tree and see the same
  errors and warnings the user sees in the GUI.
- **Private extension modules** — see [below](#private-extension-modules-eplan_mcp_extensions).

A tool-by-tool reference lives in [the project wiki](https://github.com/covagashi/eplan-rag-mcp/wiki).

#### Discovery mode

`EPLAN_MCP_MODE=discovery` publishes 13 tools instead of 199, trading a token-heavy tool
list for one extra search round-trip per task. It is worth it for MCP clients that send
every tool's full schema on every request.

**Skip it in Claude Code.** Claude Code already defers tool schemas itself — a name list up
front, a schema fetched on demand — so the `full` 199-tool list already costs it about as
little as `discovery`'s 13 would, and layering discovery's search → describe → call
indirection on top only adds a round-trip. The tradeoff and the measurements are in
[`eplan-p8-mcp-server/mcp_server/README.md`](eplan-p8-mcp-server/mcp_server/README.md#discovery-mode-eplan_mcp_mode).

### Remote documentation RAGs (P8, EEC Pro, 2027)

Already deployed and ready to use — no local data required:

```bash
# EPLAN Electric P8 documentation (2026, semantic search)
claude mcp add eplan-rag -- cmd /c npx mcp-remote https://rag2026.covaga.xyz/mcp

# EPLAN EEC Pro 2026 documentation
claude mcp add eecpro-rag -- cmd /c npx mcp-remote https://rageecpro.covaga.xyz/mcp

# EPLAN Electric P8 documentation (2027, keyword/full-text search)
claude mcp add eplan-wiki-2027 -- cmd /c npx mcp-remote https://rag2027.covaga.xyz/mcp
```

`eplan-wiki-2027` is deliberately a separate server rather than a 2026 → 2027 upgrade of
`eplan-rag`: it indexes a different doc version *and* uses a different search mode (SQLite
FTS5/bm25 keyword matching over [`cloudflare-rag-eplan-2027/`](https://github.com/covagashi/eplan-cloudflare-rags/tree/main/cloudflare-rag-eplan-2027)'s
bundled wiki, versus Vectorize + bge semantic search). Measured head-to-head on real
queries they fail differently: FTS5 wins exact-name lookups ("what is the signature of X"),
semantic search wins when the query shares no vocabulary with the docs at all. Install both.

Both also expose a plain REST API, which is convenient for verifying EPLAN action names and
parameters while developing:

```bash
curl -X POST https://rag2026.covaga.xyz/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "export project pdf", "topK": 3}'

curl -X POST https://rag2027.covaga.xyz/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "FindAction", "topK": 3}'
```

See [`cloudflare-rag-eplan-p8/README.md`](https://github.com/covagashi/eplan-cloudflare-rags/blob/main/cloudflare-rag-eplan-p8/README.md) and
[`cloudflare-rag-eecpro/README.md`](https://github.com/covagashi/eplan-cloudflare-rags/blob/main/cloudflare-rag-eecpro/README.md) for the tools, REST
endpoints and architecture.

### Visual symbol RAG (new)

Identify EPLAN electrical symbols from images — a cropped glyph from a PDF,
schematic or screenshot in, the real `short_name` out:

- Index: 33,502 EPLAN symbol images (IEC/NFPA) embedded with CLIP ViT-B/32
  (512-dim, cosine) into Cloudflare Vectorize, from
  [`covaga/electrical-symbols-dataset`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/covaga/electrical-symbols-dataset).
- Public endpoint `https://symbols.covaga.xyz` (same open pattern as the
  other RAGs — no credentials):

```bash
# vector = CLIP ViT-B/32 L2-normalized embedding of the symbol image
curl -X POST https://symbols.covaga.xyz/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"vector": [0.01, -0.02, "...512 floats..."], "topK": 5}'
```

Each match carries `short_name`, catalog `number`, `description` and
`variant_id`, plus a cosine score — the `short_name` is the identifier EPLAN
API calls expect. Re-indexing and redeploy run through GitHub Actions in
[`cloudflare-rag-symbols/`](https://github.com/covagashi/eplan-cloudflare-rags/tree/main/cloudflare-rag-symbols).

#### Using it from this MCP server

A ready-made extension ships in
[`eplan-p8-mcp-server/extensions/symbol_search.py`](./eplan-p8-mcp-server/extensions/symbol_search.py).
Enable it and the agent gets an `eplan_symbol_search` tool:

```powershell
pip install sentence-transformers pillow requests
set EPLAN_MCP_EXTENSIONS=<repo>\eplan-p8-mcp-server\extensions
```

Then, pointed at a cropped symbol image, Claude calls
`eplan_symbol_search(image_path="C:\\...\\crop.png")` → the image is embedded
locally with CLIP → `symbols.covaga.xyz` returns candidates like
`F1 (no. 50, variant B) — Fuse, single-pole` → use the top `short_name` in
EPLAN API calls. No Cloudflare token needed: the Worker holds the index
binding.

### Claude Code skill for EPLAN development

The MCP servers let Claude *act* on EPLAN. The
[**eplan-development**](https://github.com/covagashi/eplan-development-skill) skill teaches
it to *write correct EPLAN code*: scripting entry points, verified action parameters,
parts-database access, Remote Client automation (dynamic ports, headless EPLAN, Cogineer),
and the production pitfalls — pseudo-asynchronous command blocking, the message-loop
monitor thread, dispose discipline, the EPLAN 2025 remoting changes.

The skill lives in its own repository and is deliberately **host-agnostic**: it assumes no
MCP server, no particular script runner and no particular documentation index, so it is
useful on its own whether or not you run anything else from here.

```
/plugin marketplace add covagashi/eplan-development-skill
/plugin install eplan-development@eplan-skills
```

This repository is also a plugin marketplace whose entry points to the same skill
repository:

```
/plugin marketplace add covagashi/eplan-rag-mcp
/plugin install eplan-development@eplan-tools
```

Manual installation and details:
[the skill's own README](https://github.com/covagashi/eplan-development-skill#readme).

## Adding new EPLAN actions

The local MCP server registers tools **dynamically** from each actions package's `__all__`
list, so adding an action takes two steps and no per-tool boilerplate.

### 1. Implement the action

In `eplan-p8-mcp-server/mcp_server/api/actions/<your_module>.py`:

```python
def open_project(project_path: str, open_mode: str = None) -> dict:
    """Open a project in EPLAN.

    Args:
        project_path: Full path to the .elk project file.
        open_mode: "Standard", "ReadOnly", or "Exclusive" (optional).
    """
    manager, error = _get_connected_manager()
    if error:
        return error
    action = _build_action("ProjectOpen", Project=project_path, OpenMode=open_mode)
    return manager.execute_action(action)
```

### 2. Export it

Add the function to the imports **and** to `__all__` in
`eplan-p8-mcp-server/mcp_server/api/actions/__init__.py`. It is then auto-registered as
`eplan_open_project`.

### 3. Restart the MCP server

The new tool becomes available once Claude / the server restarts.

### 4. Validate against the official docs (optional)

`eplan-p8-mcp-server/tools/validate_actions.py` cross-checks every action name and
parameter declared in the wrappers against the official EPLAN docs RAG and writes a
markdown report:

```bash
python eplan-p8-mcp-server/tools/validate_actions.py
```

![EPLAN test](image-1.png)

### Tips

1. **Verify against the docs.** Use the remote P8 RAG (`https://rag2026.covaga.xyz`) to
   confirm the exact EPLAN action name and its parameters.
2. **Write meaningful docstrings and type hints.** They become the tool description and
   input schema the LLM sees and relies on.
3. **Handle paths carefully.** Windows paths need escaping (`\\`) or forward slashes (`/`).

## Private extension modules (`EPLAN_MCP_EXTENSIONS`)

The server can load **extra tool modules from outside this repository** — company-specific
or private tooling (custom add-in test harnesses, internal workflows) that must not live in
a public repo.

Point the `EPLAN_MCP_EXTENSIONS` environment variable at one or more directories (separated
by `;` on Windows). Every top-level `*.py` file there that does not start with `_` is
imported at startup, and its `__all__` functions are registered as MCP tools exactly like
the built-in actions:

```python
# my_company_tools.py  (in a private repo, NOT in eplan-rag-mcp)
TOOL_PREFIX = "acme_"          # optional, default "eplan_"
__all__ = ["run_smoke_test"]

import actions                  # the server's api/ folder is on sys.path
from actions._base import _get_connected_manager

def run_smoke_test(project_path: str) -> dict:
    """Docstring becomes the tool description the LLM sees."""
    clone = actions.scratch_project_create(project_path)
    ...
    return {"success": True}
```

Rules and behaviour:

- `TOOL_PREFIX` namespaces the tools (`acme_run_smoke_test` above).
- Extensions may import everything the built-in actions use: `actions`, `actions._base`,
  `actions.scripted._execute_script` (run C# inside EPLAN), `eplan_connection`.
- A broken extension is reported on stderr and skipped; it never prevents the server from
  starting.
- `eplan_list_extensions` shows what was loaded.

Combined with the lifecycle and scratch-fixture tools, this enables a fully unattended loop
for developing private EPLAN add-ins: build the DLL → deploy → `eplan_app_restart` → verify
the add-in's actions registered (for example via a `FindAction` script) → run them against a
disposable scratch project → `eplan_get_system_messages` to catch anything EPLAN complained
about.

## EPLAN version selection (automatic)

There is **nothing to configure**. On startup the server scans
`C:\Program Files\EPLAN\Platform` for installed versions and:

- **Auto mode (default):** `eplan_connect` targets the **newest installed version** and
  picks the matching .NET runtime automatically — coreclr for EPLAN 2027+, .NET Framework
  for 2026 and older.
- **Explicit mode:** the LLM can call `eplan_versions` to list what is installed and then
  connect to a specific one with `eplan_connect(version="2026")` — e.g. "connect to
  eplan 2026".

Notes:

- EPLAN installed somewhere non-standard? Set `EPLAN_PLATFORM_ROOT` to its `Platform` folder.
- Once one version's DLLs are loaded into the process, switching versions requires
  restarting the MCP server — a .NET runtime cannot be swapped at runtime.
- `eplan_connect` also accepts a `host` (and `"host:port"`) to reach an EPLAN instance on
  another machine; port auto-detection only works on localhost.
