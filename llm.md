# LLM Operating Guide — EPLAN AI Automation Toolkit

This file tells you (the LLM) what this toolkit lets you **do** and **configure**.
It assumes you are connected through one or more of the MCP servers described here.

The local `eplan` action server is maintained in this repository. The three
Cloudflare documentation RAG servers are maintained separately in
[eplan-cloudflare-rags](https://github.com/covagashi/eplan-cloudflare-rags):
[P8 2026](https://github.com/covagashi/eplan-cloudflare-rags/tree/main/cloudflare-rag-eplan-p8),
[P8 2027](https://github.com/covagashi/eplan-cloudflare-rags/tree/main/cloudflare-rag-eplan-2027),
and [EEC Pro 2026](https://github.com/covagashi/eplan-cloudflare-rags/tree/main/cloudflare-rag-eecpro).
The [eplan-development skill](https://github.com/covagashi/eplan-development-skill)
also has its own repository.

## 1. What you are connected to

There are up to **four MCP servers**, each a different capability:

| MCP server | Kind | What it lets you do |
|------------|------|---------------------|
| `eplan` (local) | Action server | **Control a running EPLAN Electric P8 instance** — open/close projects, export, import, reports, checks, renumber, parts DB, settings, run C# scripts, etc. |
| `eplan-rag` (remote) | Knowledge | **Look up the EPLAN P8 API** (2026 docs, actions/classes/properties/parameters) via **semantic search** (Vectorize + bge-base). |
| `eplan-wiki-2027` (remote) | Knowledge | **Look up the EPLAN P8 API** (2027 docs) via **keyword/full-text search** (SQLite FTS5 + bm25). Prefer this over `eplan-rag` when you already know or can guess the exact class/method/property name — measured head-to-head, FTS5 wins that case and semantic search wins only when the query shares no vocabulary with the docs at all. |
| `eecpro-rag` (remote) | Knowledge | **Look up the EPLAN EEC Pro 2026** documentation via semantic search. |

If `eplan-rag`/`eplan-wiki-2027` aren't connected, you can still query them over REST:
`POST https://rag2026.covaga.xyz/search` (semantic, 2026) or
`POST https://rag2027.covaga.xyz/search` (keyword, 2027), body `{"query": "...", "topK": 5}`.
Use one of these whenever you are unsure of an exact action name or parameter —
**do not guess EPLAN action parameters**.

## 2. The local `eplan` action server

It exposes **220 tools** (full tool-by-tool reference: [the project wiki](https://github.com/covagashi/eplan-rag-mcp/wiki)):

- **8 connection/utility tools**: `eplan_versions`, `eplan_servers`,
  `eplan_connect`, `eplan_status`, `eplan_ping`, `eplan_test`,
  `eplan_disconnect`, `eplan_list_extensions`.
- **203 EPLAN action tools** → `eplan_<action>` (e.g. `eplan_open_project`).
  Includes 5 discovery tools (`eplan_settings_list_children`,
  `eplan_list_schemes`, `eplan_list_report_templates`, `eplan_list_layers`,
  `eplan_list_enums`) that enumerate real EPLAN catalogs instead of guessing,
  7 live-DataModel tools (`eplan_live_query_functions`,
  `eplan_live_query_pages`, `eplan_live_set_function_text`,
  `eplan_live_set_connection_designations`,
  `eplan_live_read_check_messages`, `eplan_live_scale_text`,
  `eplan_live_set_layer`) that read/edit the open project's
  object model via runtime reflection (see §4 below) - the last of these reaches
  a different namespace still (`Eplan.EplApi.EServices.PrjMessagesCollection`,
  the itemized "Message management" results a check run produces, which
  `eplan_get_system_messages` cannot see), 2 API-introspection tools
  (`eplan_api_types`, `eplan_api_describe`) that ask the loaded object model
  what it declares - namespaces, types, member signatures, property
  read/write access and enum numeric values - using the same reflection but
  no project and no LockingStep, since they read metadata rather than data.
  They exist because the CS0234 block is compile-time only: all 26
  `Eplan.EplApi.*` namespaces / 606 public types are reachable at runtime, so
  writing against this API means looking members up constantly, and the
  alternative was a hand-written throwaway script per question. Deliberately
  2 tools and not a wrapper per class - same call as the action catalog
  below, for the same reason. 12 schematic-authoring
  tools on that same reflection scaffold (`eplan_live_symbol_catalog`,
  `eplan_live_create_page`, `eplan_live_place_symbol`,
  `eplan_live_connect_pins`, `eplan_live_read_page`,
  `eplan_live_remove_placement`) that CREATE a schematic rather than only
  reading one - every write returns the page read-back as proof and an undo
  handle, and writes refuse a project outside the scratch root unless
  `allow_real_project=True`, plus `eplan_live_verify_page` (check a page against
  a description written in live_read_page's own schema, so the read format
  doubles as the specification format) and `eplan_live_set_device_tag` (a placed
  function is anonymous until tagged; a duplicate tag is refused by default
  because it would MERGE devices) and `eplan_live_read_connections` (the LOGICAL
  connections - what is actually wired to what, as opposed to where a line was
  drawn; read-only, and it reports when connections look ungenerated rather than
  letting an empty list read as "nothing is wired"; `device=` scopes it to one
  device or terminal strip, and it reports `CONNECTION_TYPE`, where 5 is
  "Jumper (automatic)" - `kindOfWire` cannot tell you that, its five members are
  IndividualConnection/Cable/Conduit/PhaseBusbar/Line) and
  `eplan_live_read_terminals` (a terminal strip's terminals with every
  jumper-bearing property EPLAN keeps on them - the saddle jumper option
  #20808, the manual jumper crests, the switching jumpers, and the sort
  code/level that order a strip; these live on the TERMINAL, not on the
  connection, so no amount of connection reading reaches them) and
  `eplan_live_connect_pins_routed` (a drawn line through a right-angled corner,
  for the diagonal case where devices share neither axis - NOT the way to wire a
  straight run, which needs no object at all) and the connection-symbol tools
  (`eplan_live_routing_catalog`, `eplan_live_place_connection_symbol`,
  `eplan_live_place_corner`, `eplan_live_place_tnode`,
  `eplan_live_place_connected` - place a device already lined up to autoconnect
  with a pin on the page, so the caller never computes a millimetre) - EPLAN wires two facing
  pins on a shared axis with an autoconnecting line and no object, so what
  actually has to be PLACED is the corners and branches, and which symbol that
  is has to be discovered rather than assumed: one measured project carries 24
  connection symbols, including two different `TNodeUp` symbols and five
  same-direction `TLRU` variants whose pins sit in different places, so these
  tools refuse to guess between rivals and report the geometry instead),
  application lifecycle
  control (`eplan_app_launch`, `eplan_app_shutdown`, `eplan_app_restart` —
  full exit/relaunch/reconnect/reopen cycles for unattended add-in
  deploy-test loops), scratch project fixtures
  (`eplan_scratch_project_create` / `_discard` / `_list` — disposable clones
  of a template project; deletion is confined to the scratch root), and
  `eplan_get_system_messages` (read EPLAN's system message tree — the same
  errors/warnings the user sees in the GUI's system messages dialog).
- **4 action-catalog tools** reaching the ~1,050 further EPLAN actions that
  exist only as GUI buttons (mined from the install's `MFTools.xml`, not
  documented, not individually wrapped — publishing one tool per action would
  have tripled the tool count): `eplan_action_catalog(search, category,
  documented_only, wrapped, available_only, limit)` to search the ~1,150-action
  registry offline, `eplan_action_describe(name)` for a registry entry + live
  `FindAction` probe, `eplan_action_run(name, params, dry_run,
  allow_unknown_params)` for validated dispatch of *any* action (rejects
  unknown names/params, with an escape hatch since many registry params are
  observed rather than documented — supersedes `execute_raw_action` for
  actions already in the registry), and `eplan_ribbon_catalog(tab, search)` to
  browse the live GUI ribbon tree and resolve a button to the action it runs.
  `available_only=True` on `action_catalog` restricts to actions the live
  probe found registered on this installation — that is necessary, not
  sufficient: `FindAction` resolving an action means its module is *loaded*,
  not that it is *licensed* to run (module licensing is enforced at
  execution time). Confirm by actually running the action.
- **4 Asset Administration Shell tools** → `aas_<action>`
  (`aas_export_part`, `aas_export_project`, `aas_inspect_package`,
  `aas_import_parts`) for AAS/AASX digital-twin export and import.

The EPLAN version is auto-detected (newest installed). If the user wants a
specific version, call `eplan_versions` to list what is installed, then
`eplan_connect(version="2026")`. Decide the version BEFORE the first connect —
once one version's DLLs are loaded, switching requires restarting the server.

Every action runs inside a C# script in EPLAN's process under `QuietMode`
(no dialogs). It is silent, safe for unattended/batch use, and returns values
EPLAN wrote back to the calling context (e.g. `PROJECT`, `PAGES`).

Each tool already carries its own description and parameter schema (generated
from the Python docstring + type hints). **Read the tool's own description before
calling it** — this guide is the map, the tool schemas are the territory.

### Result shape

Tools return JSON. Actions typically return:

```json
{ "success": true, "parameters": { "PROJECT": "C:\\...\\Proj.elk" } }
```

`success: false` with a `message`/`error` means the EPLAN action itself failed —
read the message; it usually points at a bad parameter or a missing precondition
(e.g. no project open).

`success: true` from a directly-executed utility (`ExecuteScript`) only means
EPLAN accepted the call. Generated scripts are one-shot `[Start]`-only classes
run via `ExecuteScript` alone — they are deliberately **not** passed through
`RegisterScript`/`UnregisterScript` (that pair is for installing a script's
persistent `[DeclareAction]`/`[DeclareEventHandler]`/`[DeclareMenu]` hooks,
which these scripts don't have; registering them anyway just produced a
spurious "script does not contain attributes for loading" warning in
EPLAN's own UI and two wasted remote-API round-trips per call).

---

## 3. Standard workflow

1. **Check / connect first.** Call `eplan_status` (or `eplan_servers` →
   `eplan_connect`). Almost every action needs an open connection. Port and
   EPLAN version are auto-detected; pass `version` only if the user asks for a
   specific one. If `eplan_servers` returns `[]` the connection usually still
   works — that empty list is a known limitation (especially right after EPLAN
   starts), not a failure: `eplan_connect` falls back to the TCP ports
   EPLAN.exe actually listens on (via netstat), then the default 49152. To
   reach EPLAN on another machine pass `host` (port required then).
2. **Pick the project context.** Most actions take an optional `project_name`. If
   omitted, EPLAN uses the **currently selected/open** project. Use
   `eplan_get_current_project` to confirm what that is.
3. **Call `eplan_<action>`** with the parameters from the tool schema.
4. **Verify unknowns via the RAG** before constructing raw actions or custom
   scripts.
5. **Report results** from the returned JSON honestly (including `success: false`).

## 4. What you can DO (capability map)

All of these exist as `eplan_*` tools:

- **Projects:** open, close, get current, compress, synchronize, upgrade, set
  language, switch type, project management tasks.
- **Backup / restore:** projects and master data.
- **Export:** PDF (project/pages), DXF/DWG (project/pages, by scheme), graphics
  (PNG/TIF/…), PXF/EPJ, 3D.
- **Import:** PXF projects, DXF/DWG into pages or as macros, PDF comments, 3D.
- **Print:** project or pages.
- **Check / verify:** project, pages, parts (with verification schemes).
- **Generate:** connections, cables.
- **Reports / evaluations:** update reports, model views, copper unfolds,
  drilling views.
- **Search:** devices, texts, all properties, page data, project data.
- **Navigation / editing:** open page, go to device, open layout space, close
  pages, get selected pages, page/macro preview, navigate to EEC.
- **Renumber:** devices, pages, cables, terminals, connections.
- **Translate:** translate project, export missing translations, remove language.
- **Device lists, labels, graphical layers, macros.**
- **Settings & properties:** import/export settings, set settings, get/set
  project / page / object properties, user properties.
- **Parts:** export/import parts lists, part selection, data source, full parts
  management API export/import.
- **PLC:** bus data export/import via converters.
- **Workspace:** open/save/clean (needs the EPLAN GUI/mainframe).
- **Data exchange:** connections/functions/pages export for external editing,
  data-configuration import/export, potential/pipeline definitions, subprojects,
  master data operations.
- **Cabinet / 3D:** cabinet weight, segment filling, topology, pre-planning data,
  segment templates.
- **Production:** NC data, production wiring.
- **Ribbon & add-ons:** export/import ribbon bar, load API module, register/
  unregister add-on, and `execute_raw_action` for any action not wrapped.
- **Scripted advanced APIs (run as C#):** direct **parts database** queries
  (`parts_db_*`), **typed settings** get/set
  (`settings_get/set_string|bool|int|double`), **PathMap** variable substitution,
  and `execute_custom_script` to run arbitrary C# inside EPLAN.
- **Live DataModel (read/edit the open project via reflection):**
  `eplan_live_query_functions`, `eplan_live_query_pages` (read, with substring
  filter + result limit), `eplan_live_set_function_text` (write `FUNC_TEXT`,
  defaults to one function at a time, returns the previous value),
  `eplan_live_set_connection_designations` (write the indexed
  `FUNC_CONNECTIONDESIGNATION` property, re-reads after writing to confirm),
  `eplan_live_read_check_messages` (page through the itemized "Message
  management" results of the last check run — `Eplan.EplApi.EServices.
  PrjMessagesCollection` — by 1-based index, matching the order EPLAN's own
  dialog lists them in; `eplan_get_system_messages` only ever sees the two
  summary lines a check run appends, never the individual entries),
  `eplan_live_scale_text` (multiply every text height in the GED selection or on
  a named page by a factor — dry-run by default, skips the `-16002` "from layer"
  sentinel and texts shared with a symbol variant, reverses with `1/factor`),
  `eplan_live_set_layer` (move the selection or a page onto one layer - default
  `EPLAN100` - and hand colour/line width back to that layer via the same
  `-16002` sentinel; dry-run by default, reports the layers the objects came
  from).
  These reach `Eplan.EplApi.DataModel`/`HEServices`/`EServices` types via
  `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()` + `Assembly.Load` fallback instead
  of a static `using`, because that `using` doesn't compile in EPLAN's script
  engine (CS0234) and, separately, the managed assembly names changed
  (`Eplan.EplApi.DataModelu` → `...DataModelNetu`) starting with EPLAN 2025/2027
  — a hardcoded old name throws `BadImageFormatException` on newer installs.

### Escape hatches

- `eplan_execute_raw_action("ActionName /PARAM:value ...")` — run any EPLAN
  action string directly (still wrapped in QuietMode). Use after confirming the
  syntax with the RAG.
- `eplan_execute_custom_script(<C# code>, timeout_seconds=30.0)` — run a full
  C# script with access to `Eplan.EplApi.*`. Write results to
  `{{RESULT_PATH}}` as JSON. Raise `timeout_seconds` for scripts that walk
  large collections (e.g. reflection over every function/page in a big
  project); the default is tuned for small scripts, not bulk enumeration.
  **If the call times out, don't assume the script is slow or the collection
  is large** — a C# compile error (e.g. the `using Eplan.EplApi.DataModel;`
  trap above) means the script never ran and never wrote a result, which is
  indistinguishable from a hang on this end. Call
  `eplan_get_system_messages(min_level="Message")` first and look for a
  `CS####`-prefixed entry naming the generated `.cs` file before raising the
  timeout or suspecting RAM/project size (confirmed live: identical timeout
  on a 400-item and a 4-item project, same root cause both times).

---

## 5. What you can CONFIGURE

- **Target EPLAN version:** auto-detected (newest installed). Override per
  session with `eplan_connect(version="2026")`; list options with
  `eplan_versions`. Non-standard install path: set the `EPLAN_PLATFORM_ROOT`
  environment variable. Switching versions after DLLs are loaded requires a
  server restart.
- **Add a new action / tool:** implement a function in
  `api/actions/<module>.py`, export it in that package's
  `__init__.py` `__all__`, restart. It auto-registers as `eplan_<name>`. The
  docstring + type hints become the tool description and schema you will see.
- **EPLAN settings at runtime:** via `eplan_set_setting` /
  `eplan_set_project_setting` (action params `set`/`value`/`index`) or the
  typed `eplan_settings_set_*` scripted tools.
- **The MCP registration itself:** `python eplan-p8-mcp-server/install.py` (own `.venv`, registers `eplan`).

---

## 6. Caveats & gotchas

- **Connect before acting.** Unconnected calls return a "Not connected" error.
- **`project_name` is optional** — omitting it uses the selected project. Pass the
  full `.elk` path to be explicit. Windows paths must be escaped (`\\`) or use `/`.
- **GUI-only actions** behave poorly headless/under QuietMode: `redraw_ged`
  (returns FALSE in QuietMode) and the `workspace` actions (need a mainframe).
- **Property actions on project/page** (`get/set_project_property`,
  `get/set_page_property`) act on the **current project / selected page(s)** and
  use `PropertyId`/`PropertyIndex`/`PropertyValue` — they do not take a project
  or page name.
- **`selectionset`** valid `TYPE` values are `PROJECT`, `PROJECTS`, `PAGES`,
  `LAYOUTSPACES` only.
- **Don't invent parameters.** When unsure, query the RAG (`rag2026.covaga.xyz`)
  for the authoritative action page.
- **Custom C# scripts can't `using Eplan.EplApi.DataModel;`** — that statement
  doesn't compile in EPLAN's script engine (CS0234). Reach DataModel/HEServices
  types via reflection instead (see the `live_*` tools in §4), and don't
  hardcode the managed assembly name — it's `...Netu`-suffixed on EPLAN
  2025/2027, not the pre-2025 name.

---

## 7. Safety — confirm before destructive actions

Treat these as outward/irreversible and **confirm with the user first** unless
explicitly authorized: deleting pages or device/parts lists, closing a project
with unsaved changes, renumbering (devices/pages/cables/terminals/connections),
restore/backup overwrites, settings changes, `set_*_property`, raw actions, and
custom C# scripts. Read-only actions (status, search, get current project,
exports to new files, parts DB queries) are safe to run as needed.
